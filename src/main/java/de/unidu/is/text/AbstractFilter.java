/**
 * This is an abstract filter implementation which allows for chaining filters.
 * Chaining filters means that the output of one filter is used as the input
 * of another filter. This makes it easy to combine simple filters for
 * advanced applications.
 *
 * <code>
 * Filter filter = new StemmerFilter(new WordSplitterFilter(null));
 * Iterator iterator = filter.apply("The quick brown fox jumps");
 * </code>
 * <p>
 * This code block chains a <code>StemmerFilter</code> with a
 * <code>WordSplitterFilter</code>. This means that the string
 * "The quick brown fox jumps" is first applied on the
 * <code>WordSplitterFilter</code>, which leads to an iterator over
 * "the", "quick", "brown", "fox" and "jumps". These objects are then applied
 * on the  <code>StemmerFilter</code>, resulting in "the", "quick", "brown",
 * "fox" and "jump" (instead of "jump").<p>
 * <p>
 * Subclasses have to implement the actual filtering method.
